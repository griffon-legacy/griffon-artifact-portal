  <p>Welcome to the Griffon artifact portal. The place where you can find information about the latest plugins and archetypes available for the Griffon framework.</p>

  <p>As it happens with many open source projects, this portal is the result of the efforts of many individuals. We value your contributions and feedback, which is why we encourage you to <span
          class="label success"><g:link controller="user" action="signup">sign-up</g:link></span>
    and and let us know what you think. Registered users can vote up artifacts and edit their details. Furthermore, they may apply for <span
          class="label notice">developer membership</span>, allowing them to publish artifacts to this site.</p>

  <p>Lastly, this site sports a <span class="label important"><g:link controller="api"
                                                                      action="index">REST API</g:link></span> that can be used to query artifact metadata and download artifact files.
